# Visual Understanding Agentic Chat Assistant 🎬
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that serves as a visual understanding agent. It processes video input, generates a detailed summary of its contents, and allows users to have multi-turn conversations about the video in real-time. The application showcases a powerful agentic workflow .This project implements an agentic chat assistant capable of processing video input, generating a detailed summary of its contents, and then engaging in multi-turn conversations with a user about the video. The solution is built as a web application using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for video uploads and chat interactions. It leverages two powerful large language models: Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash for video analysis and Llama 3.3 70B via Groq Cloud for real-time conversational responses.

## Architecture Diagram
The system follows a two-stage, decoupled architecture.

Video Processing Stage: A user uploads a video via the Streamlit UI. The video is sent to the Gemini 1.5 Flash API, which acts as the Video Agent. This agent analyzes the video based on a detailed prompt and generates a comprehensive, time-stamped summary. This summary is then stored in the Streamlit st.session_state.

Conversational Stage: Once the summary is generated, the user can ask questions. The Groq Conversational Agent is activated, taking the video summary and the chat history as its context. It uses the Llama 3.1 70B model via the low-latency Groq Cloud API to generate fast, accurate responses.

## Tech Stack Justification
Streamlit: Chosen for its ability to rapidly build beautiful and interactive web applications in pure Python. It provides a user-friendly frontend for the prototype, enabling seamless interaction without the need for complex web development.

Gemini 1.5 Flash: A multimodal model with a large context window, making it ideal for processing video files and generating detailed, time-stamped event logs and summaries. Its ability to understand visual information is crucial for the video analysis part of the project.

Groq Cloud (with Llama 3.3 70B-versatile): Selected for its exceptional inference speed and low latency. This ensures that the conversational part of the application feels instantaneous, providing a highly responsive and satisfying chat experience. Using Groq avoids the need to download and run a large model locally, which simplifies deployment and significantly enhances performance.

## ✨ Features
In-Depth Video Analysis: Utilizes Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash to analyze videos up to 2 minutes long. It generates a comprehensive, time-stamped report on key events, object tracking, and potential violations.

Real-time Conversational AI: Employs Llama 3.1 70B through the low-latency Groq Cloud API to enable fast and context-aware chat interactions with the video summary.

Modular Codebase: The project is structured into separate modules for agents, UI components, and the main application logic, making the code clean, readable, and easy to maintain.

Persistent & Downloadable Summary: The generated video summary remains visible during the entire chat session and can be downloaded as a text file for offline use.

Intuitive UI: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows for simple video uploads and seamless chat interactions.

🏛️ Project Structure
The project is organized into a modular and scalable directory structure.

## File Breakdown:
.streamlit/secrets.toml: Securely stores your API keys.

uploaded_videos/: The directory where your uploaded video files are saved.

src/agents/: Contains the logic for the different AI agents.

video_summarizer_agent.py: Handles the video upload and summarization using the Gemini API.

chat_agent.py: Manages the conversational agent and Groq API calls.

src/ui/: Contains reusable Streamlit UI components.

components.py: Holds functions for displaying chat history and handling user input logic.

app.py: The main entry point of the application. It orchestrates the flow by importing functions from the src directory and setting up the Streamlit UI.

## 🚀 End-to-End Execution Guide

## 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.8+ installed.

A Gemini API Key.

A Groq API Key.

### 2. Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Step a. Clone the repository
First, clone the project from your repository.

Bash

```
git clone git@github.com:ratnesh134/Video-Summarization-ChatBot.git
cd your-repo
```
Step b. Create a virtual environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Step c. Install dependencies
Install all required Python libraries.

Bash

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step d. Configure API keys
Create a directory named .streamlit and a file inside it named secrets.toml.


```
your_project_directory/
├── .streamlit/
│   └── secrets.toml
```
Open secrets.toml and add your API keys. Replace "your_gemini_api_key" and "your_groq_api_key" with your actual keys.

Ini, TOML

 .streamlit/secrets.toml

```
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key"
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
```

## 3. Run the Application
With the setup complete, you can now run the Streamlit application from your project's root directory.

Bash

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will launch the application in your web browser.

### 4. Usage
Upload a Video: Use the file uploader widget to select an MP4 or MOV file.

Wait for Analysis: The app will automatically save the video and send it to the Gemini API. A spinner will indicate that the summary is being generated.

View Summary & Chat: Once the analysis is complete, the video summary will be displayed, along with a "Download Summary" button. You can now use the chat box to ask questions about the video's content. The assistant will remember your conversation, allowing for multi-turn dialogue.

Enjoy using your Visual Understanding Agent!
